# How to ask for a Letter of Recommendation

*or a brief note on the relationships I want to have with you*

If you want to ask me for a letter of recommendation for a job, graduate school, visa, residency or grant, please check the following.

## Please proceed only if you check 5 or more of the qualifications. 


- Did you read the Stanford University Undergrad Guide on [Asking for a Letter of Recommendation](https://undergrad.stanford.edu/academic-planning/engage-faculty/asking-letters-recommendation)? Nothing I write in this note is outside of the convention. 
- Were you a student or staff at the School for Poetic Computation? Were you a student in other institutions I teach such as NYU? If we worked together, did I hire you as a contractor or did you participate in a collaborative project? 
- Did we have a meaningful interaction while you were a student or colleague? If so, remind me of the conversation we had and why I can be a good reference for you. 
- Did you get in touch with me in the past 6 months besides the letter request? I appreciate casual updates on your research, creative work via direct email or in person. Interactions on the social media and slack do not count. 
- Did you participate in SFPC events or community after completing the program? such as SFPC Salon, student showcase and other events, or watch livestream and stayed active on slack channels?  
- Are you applying to three or less schools or positions? If you are applying to more than three, you may need to rethink what you want to achieve. 
- Do you have your work organized and made available for me and the world? Is your website up to date with a personal statement, project descriptions, images, video documentations? If it's an open source project, is your code repository maintained with the latest code and schematics?  
- Are you asking me at least 1 month before deadline for the letter of recommendation? 
 

## How to ask for a letter of recommendation 
 
1. Write an email to me with a title "Request for a Letter of Recommedation" and include which opportunities you are hoping to apply, why you are asking me instead of other teachers, what is expected of me (deadlines, letter formats).
2. Wait up to 1 week for my response. I will do my best to respond in timely manner. If no response, I maybe travelling or in a production. Apologies in advnace. Please ask another teacher or colleague. 
3. Give me 1 month to write and submit the letter. Do not wait until the last minute to send me a letter submission form. 
4. Follow up with me after admissions process has been completed. Let me know if you got into the positions or not. 


# Notes

I love to support my students and colleagues for their next steps. That's why I teach and organize at SFPC and other institutions. However, each year I am asked by many people to write letters. It's become a large quantity in the past years and it's challenging to keep track of them during the winter holiday season. I would love to support my students to achive their goal, but I need to be more explicit about the types of interaction I want to have and expectations for my students and colleagues. 

I don't have a template that I repeat for the letters. I write a new letter for each student and customize for each of their applications. There are some people who ask to have a letter drafted by the student, make a few edits and sign them. I don't think that's what a letter of recommendation is supposed to be. 

Please understand you are asking me to be liable for you. If you are applying to a graduate school, often times I have a professional and personal relationships with the admissions officers and professors in the institutions. I need to be mindful about the number and quality of students I'm recommending to their institution. 

Some people who asked for a letter didn't update me about the progress. This is disheartening because I put work into writing a letter, but they don't put work into informing me about their progress. Always keep the letter writer posted after your final decision. 

Consider this as a proposal to have a great relationship with me and other teachers over a long period of time. You don't want to make teachers feel underappreciated by keeping them in the dark. For you, it may feel like a one-time thing to apply for a school or job. For me, and other teachers, it's an ongoing relationship that spans over many years. We want to make sure we recommend our students and staff to the right opportunity. 


I and other teachers are not obliged to write a letter of recommendation to a student. I want to write a letter only for students I feel very strongly supportive of. If I declined to write you a letter, it doesn't mean I don't like you. It's an opportunity to build a more meaningful interaction and understanding over time. I may decline your request to write a letter if I've already committed to writing many letters and don't have the time to justfully represent you. 
 
There's nothing more rewarding than contributing to a former student or staff's career. I hope to become a support structure for our community and wish to maintain a good professional relationship and friendship over the years. I imagine I may ask you for a letter of recommendation in the future.  

Some applications ask for a 'Professional Contact' It is a considerably less work to be listed, as no letter is required at the time of submission. However, it can be potentially equal amount of work. Please ask with the same kind of thoughtfulness of asking for a letter of recommendation.

Thanks

Hugs
