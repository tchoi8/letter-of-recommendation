# Letter of Recommendation

If you were my student or staff at the School for Poetic Computation or NYU ITP, and if you want to ask me for a letter of recommendation for job, graduate school or residency/grant, please check the following.

Qualification: 
- Did you have a meaningful interaction with me while you were a student? If so, remind me of the conversation we had or why you chose me to be your reference. 
- Did you get in touch with me in the past 6 months? I recommend casual updates on your research, creative work via direct email. 
- Did you participate in SFPC programs or community after completing the program? Come join the SFPC Salon, student showcase and other events. 
- Are you applying to three or less schools or positions? If you are applying to more than three, you may need to rethink what you want to achieve. 
- Is your website up to date with text, image, video documentation? Do you have your work organized and made available for me and the world? 
- Are you asking me at least 1 month before deadline for the letter of recommendation? 

Please proceed only if you check 3 or more of qualifications. 

1. Write an email with a title "Request for a Letter of Recommedation" and include which opportunities you are hoping to apply, why you are asking me instead of other teachers, what is expected of me (deadlines, letter formats).
2. Wait up to 1 week for my response. I will do my best to respond in timely manner. If no response, I maybe travelling or on a production. Please ask another teacher or colleague. 
3. Give me 1 month to write and submit the letter. Do not wait until the last minute to send me a letter submission form. 
4. Follow up with me after admissions process has been completed. Let me know if you got into the positions or not. 


# Notes

Understand it's a lot of work to write a letter and also to submit them. I am asked by many alums to write letters, and it's become uncontrollable in the past years. 
I would love to support my students to achive their goal, but I need to be more explicit about the types of interaction I want to have. 

Many students who ask for a letter don't update me about the progress. This is especially disheartening because I put work into writing a letter, but they don't put work into informing me about their progress. Always keep me posted after final decision. Consider this as a proposal to have a great relationship with me and other teachers over a long period of time. You don't want to make teachers feel used and underappreciated by keeping them in the dark.
